Just walked out of Janym Qazaqstan and my head's somewhere between confused and enchanted. Is it normal to be both exhausted and weirdly exhilarated after a movie? I mean, I'm sitting there, popcorn bag like a deflated balloon on my lap, and I can't decide if I just witnessed art or a fever dream. 

The opening scene had me like, “Whoa, that’s some cinematography,” but then five minutes later, I was questioning why the main character was named after a fruit. Was it supposed to be profound? Symbolic? My brain short-circuited like a toaster in a bathtub trying to figure that one out. 

> Anyway, this movie’s all about Kazakhstan, but not in a National Geographic kind of way. It’s more like a love letter mixed with a cheesy romantic comedy but without the happy ending you expect. Halfway through, they hit you with some dialogue that's so deep, you feel like it hijacked a philosophy textbook. I think I caught myself rolling my eyes, and then simultaneously thinking, Maybe I should be taking notes?

The soundtrack was another rollercoaster. One moment you're all “this is a banger,” then out of nowhere, there’s this sad violin piece that makes you question all your life choices. Thanks a lot, Janym, for an unexpected existential crisis.

There was this guy a few seats over who kept laughing at what felt like non-jokes. I wish I lived in his universe, honestly. He seemed to be having the time of his life while I was just trying to decipher the subplot about time travel... or was that a metaphor for something else entirely?

You know, I have no clue why I just typed something that looks like coding. Brain's fried. But this movie? It sticks with you, like chewing gum on your favorite shoes. Oddly nostalgic, strangely messy, yet somehow kind of... endearing? Maybe give it a watch, or download the movie if you’re into that legally gray area. Just don’t blame me if you walk out of it feeling like you’ve been clobbered with a cultural encyclopedia wrapped in surrealist poetry.
